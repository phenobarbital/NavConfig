## 3. Module Breakdown

> Define the discrete modules that will be implemented.
> These directly map to Task Artifacts in Phase 2.

#### Delegation-eligible modules

Mark which modules can be implemented by the targeted writer from an
already-decided TASK packet. Architecture decisions always stay with the
thinking model; eligibility only means "the design is complete enough that
writing the code is mechanical".

| Module | Eligible? | Decided patterns / exact contracts | Why not (if no) |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1: <name> | yes / no | <signatures, error codes, file layout already fixed> | <open design question> |


### Module 1: <Name>
- **Path**: `parrot/path/to/module.py`
- **Responsibility**: What this module does
- **Depends on**: existing module or Module N from this spec
- **Interface Skeleton** *(signatures + docstrings only — bodies belong to task blueprints, FEAT-545)*:
  ```python
  # parrot/path/to/module.py  (new | modifies parrot/path/to/module.py:NN)
  class NewComponent(ExistingBase):  # ExistingBase verified: parrot/base.py:NN
      """<purpose>."""
      async def method(self, param: Type) -> ReturnType:
          """<contract: returns …; raises … when …>."""
  ```

### Module 2: <Name>
- **Path**: `parrot/path/to/module2.py`
- **Responsibility**: ...
- **Depends on**: Module 1
- **Interface Skeleton** *(signatures + docstrings only — bodies belong to task blueprints, FEAT-545)*:
  ```python
  # parrot/path/to/module.py  (new | modifies parrot/path/to/module.py:NN)
  class NewComponent(ExistingBase):  # ExistingBase verified: parrot/base.py:NN
      """<purpose>."""
      async def method(self, param: Type) -> ReturnType:
          """<contract: returns …; raises … when …>."""
  ```

## 4. Test Specification

### Unit Tests
| Test | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `test_component_init` | Module 1 | Validates initialization with valid config |
| `test_component_error` | Module 1 | Handles invalid input gracefully |

### Integration Tests
| Test | Description |
|---|---|
| `test_end_to_end_flow` | Full pipeline from input to output |

### Test Data / Fixtures
```python
# Key fixtures needed
@pytest.fixture
def sample_config():
    return {...}
```

### E2E Scenarios

> Optional (FEAT-581) — only for a feature that exercises the deterministic
> E2E gate (`parrot e2e run` / `parrot e2e verify`). Omit this whole
> subsection, and the frontmatter `e2e` key above, for a feature with no E2E
> surface; an absent policy defaults to `optional` once a plan is loaded.

- **Policy**: `required` | `optional` | `none` — must match frontmatter
  `e2e.policy` exactly. An invalid value fails plan loading closed; it is
  never silently coerced to a default.
- **Required deterministic scenarios**: stable `ScenarioSpec.id` values this
  feature must cover, each with enumerated pytest node IDs (never a bare
  directory or wildcard — a node ID belongs to exactly one scenario). A
  `required` policy demands at least one required, codified
  (non-exploratory, node-bearing) scenario; an empty or all-exploratory
  scenario list under `required` is a spec defect, not something the loader
  defaults around.
- **Live / exploratory scenarios**: listed separately from the deterministic
  scenarios above, never described as "deterministic". Live scenarios call
  a real provider under explicit `PARROT_TEST_REAL_LLM=1` opt-in and a
  request budget; exploratory scenarios declare no node IDs and can never
  be `required`.
- **Generated plan**: the complete `e2e-plan.md` frontmatter
  (`schema_version`, `feature_id`, `spec_path`, `policy`, `targets`,
  `scenarios`, `budget`, `run_timeout_s`) is produced during task
  decomposition once node IDs are frozen — do not fabricate concrete node
  IDs at spec-authoring time; its evidence is not available yet either.

| Scenario ID | Tier | Required | Target(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<scenario-id>` | deterministic | yes | `<target-id>` | enumerated node IDs added once frozen |
| `<scenario-id>` | live | no | `<target-id>` | explicit opt-in only; never called deterministic |
| `<scenario-id>` | exploratory | no (never required) | `<target-id>` | candidates only, human-reviewed |

Validation commands (exact node IDs supplied by the generated plan):
```bash
pytest <package>/tests/unit/e2e/ -q
PARROT_TEST_E2E=1 parrot e2e run --plan <path-to-generated>/e2e-plan.md
parrot e2e verify --plan <path-to-generated>/e2e-plan.md
```

- [ ] All unit tests pass (`pytest tests/unit/ -v`)
- [ ] All integration tests pass (`pytest tests/integration/ -v`)
- [ ] Documentation updated in `docs/`
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing public API
- [ ] Performance benchmark: <metric> within <threshold>
- [ ] Criterion N

---

## 6. Codebase Contract

> **CRITICAL — Anti-Hallucination Anchor**
> This section is the single source of truth for what exists in the codebase.
> Implementation agents MUST NOT reference imports, attributes, or methods
> not listed here without first verifying they exist via `grep` or `read`.

### Verified Imports
<!-- Exact import statements confirmed to work. Agents MUST use these verbatim. -->
```python
from parrot.module import ClassName  # verified: parrot/module/__init__.py:NN
```

### Existing Class Signatures
<!-- Exact signatures of classes/methods that tasks will extend or call.
     Include attribute types and method signatures with line numbers. -->
```python
# parrot/path/to/file.py
class ExistingClass(BaseClass):
    attribute: Type  # line NN
    async def method(self, param: Type) -> ReturnType:  # line NN
```

### Integration Points
<!-- How new code connects to existing code. Specify exact method calls. -->
| New Component | Connects To | Via | Verified At |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NewClass` | `ExistingClass.method()` | method call | `path/file.py:NN` |

### Does NOT Exist (Anti-Hallucination)
<!-- Things that look plausible but DO NOT exist in the codebase.
     Prevents agents from inventing imports or attributes. -->
- ~~`parrot.module.NonExistentThing`~~ — does not exist
- ~~`ClassName.phantom_method()`~~ — not a real method

### Edit Sites (Blueprint Anchors)
<!-- One row per file the §3 modules will touch. `/sdd-task` turns each row into an
     Implementation Blueprint block, so the anchor is verified ONCE per feature here
     instead of once per task. Keep it to files the modules actually change — this
     table is re-read on every downstream turn, so rows must earn their place.

     Verified against: <short SHA of the base commit at spec time>

     Anchors go stale between spec time and task time. `/sdd-task` MUST re-run the
     `grep -c` for every row it uses; this table saves the search, not the check. -->

| File | Action | Verbatim anchor line | Verified at | Occurrences |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/<dist>/src/<pkg>/module/file.py` | MODIFY | `def existing_method(self) -> None:` | `file.py:NN` | 1 |
| `packages/<dist>/src/<pkg>/module/new_file.py` | CREATE | — | — | — |

- A **CREATE** row declares only the path the module adds; it needs no anchor.
- **Occurrences > 1** means the one-line anchor is ambiguous. Quote 2–3 lines of
  surrounding context in the anchor cell so the blueprint block can attach uniquely.
- An anchor that cannot be verified is written `(unverified — check before use)`,
  never guessed.

## 7. Implementation Notes & Constraints

> Architecture decisions stay with the thinking model. A delegated
> implementation may only express a decision already recorded here and in
> the TASK's implementation blocks — it must never invent an API, choose a
> file, or resolve an open design question.


### Patterns to Follow
- Use `AbstractBase` pattern from `parrot/base/`
- Follow async-first design throughout
- Pydantic models for all structured data
- Comprehensive logging with `self.logger`

### Known Risks / Gotchas
- Risk 1 and mitigation
- Risk 2 and mitigation

### External Dependencies
| Package | Version | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `package` | `>=x.y` | why needed |

---

## 8. Open Questions

> Questions that must be resolved before or during implementation.

- [ ] Question 1 — *Owner: name*
- [ ] Question 2 — *Owner: name*

---

## 9. Design Research Cross-Check

> Independent design opinion from the `codex` seat over the **accepted exploration
> doc** (never over this spec). Model: `<model>` · Status: completed | skipped (<reason>)
> · Transcript: `sdd/state/<FEAT-ID>/design_research/`
> Every row is a suggestion the reviewer made; the disposition is the spec author's
> call (CONFIRM = folded into the spec, REJECT = reason recorded, ESCALATE = §8 question).

| # | Suggestion (kind) | Disposition | Reason | Landed in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | <title> (architecture) | CONFIRM | <why adopted> | §2 Overview |
| S2 | <title> (testing) | REJECT | <why not> | — |
| S3 | <title> (risk) | ESCALATE | <what the human must decide> | §8 Q<N> |

Summary: **<C>** confirmed · **<R>** rejected · **<E>** escalated.
